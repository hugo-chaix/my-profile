			<h3> <em>Project for Max Havelaar</em> </h3> 
				<h4> Who? </h4>
					<p> Max Havelaar’s mission is to <strong>identify, accompany and regularly evaluate any actors</strong> that commercializes a <strong>product issued from fairtrade</strong>, and that wants its final product to be labeled. </p>
				<h4> What? </h4>
					<p> In this company, I would like to propose a big <strong>marketing campaign</strong> centered on the productors themselves: the idea would be to go meet them, and communicate about these people that are behind our products, as well as their method of production to <strong>spread awareness about the possibility to produce fairly, while keeping a financial comfort.</strong> </p>
